has '+launcher' => ( default => sub { "iptables" } );

has '+startDependsOnServices' => ( is => 'ro', default => sub { ["ipset"] } );

=head2 startService

"Start" iptables by generating rules

=cut

sub startService {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    # Saving existing system rules
    pf::iptables::save() unless ($self->runningServices);

    # Flushing currently configured rules
    pf::iptables::flush();

    # Generating and applying PacketFence rules
    pf::iptables::restore(pf::iptables::generate());

    # Since iptables is not a running service, it doesn't have a PID associated to it.
    # We use -1 as a PID for theses kind of "services"
    open (my $fh, '>>' . $self->pidFile);
    print $fh "-1";
    close ($fh);

    return 1;
}

=head2 stop

"Stop" iptables by flushing rules

=cut

sub stop {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    # Flushing PacketFence rules
    pf::iptables::flush();

    # Restoring previously configured (system?) rules
    pf::iptables::restore();

    unlink $self->pidFile;

    return 1;
}

=head2 isAlive

Check if iptables is "alive"
Since it is never really stopped then we check if rules are defined and if the fake PID exists

=cut

sub isAlive {
    my ( $self, $pid ) = @_;

    $pid = $self->pid;
    my $running = pf::iptables::check();

    return ( defined($pid) && $running );
}
